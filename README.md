# Brief Instruction

Open terminal at the root folder and enter commands:\
`npm install`\
`npm start`

If you don't have npm on your machine, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and install Node.js first.

npm should be automatically set up after you have Node.js installed.

Lastly, after the server is started by running the commands above, go to http://localhost:3000/ to use the course planner.
